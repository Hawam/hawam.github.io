# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
As a Unity Developer 🎮, I create immersive and interactive 3D games 🕹️ and simulations for various domains and platforms. I have over 5 years of experience 💼 in developing mobile 📱 and desktop 🖥️ apps using Unity, C#, AR 🕶️, VR 🥽, Playfab, Photon, Git, and GitHub Actions.

I have a Bachelor's degree 🎓 in Computer Science from Mansoura University and a certification in Developing Android Apps 📲 from Udacity. I'm passionate ❤️ about learning new technologies 🚀 and applying them to create innovative and impactful solutions. I'm looking for a challenging position where I can leverage my skills and experience to collaborate with a creative and highly motivated team. 👥✨
