# Johario

my first venture into the world of game development with **Mobileaders**. As the creative force behind this Unity-driven desktop card game, I pioneered the integration of scanning real physical cards into the gameplay. 'Johario' is not just a game; it's an immersive experience that blurs the lines between the physical and digital worlds, inviting players to engage in a unique and interactive environment. This project, which I hold in high regard, represents a significant achievement in my programming career, and I am excited to showcase it as a highlight of my portfolio.
