# Gas Plant

**Gas Plant** is a Virtual gas plant 3D interactive software that provides a complete control system for field environment. It's an effective tool for teaching the process, control and operation of gas processing plants for control engineers. The software allows users to control the gas flow, temperature, pressure and other parameters of the plant in real-time. The software also provides a 3D visualization of the plant, which allows users to see how the gas is being processed and how the plant is laid out.

We used HYSYS to simulate the chemical processing and made a SCADA system emulator using the HYSYS library and Unity game engine. The emulator allows users to control and view a virtual gas processing plant in real-time. The SCADA system is a software system that allows users to monitor and control industrial processes remotely. The emulator was created to mimic the functionality of a real SCADA system, with the ability to view and control various parameters of a gas processing plant in real-time. This tool was designed to be a comprehensive and interactive way to learn about gas processing plants without the need for physical access to a real plant. The emulator was created using the Unity game engine and the HYSYS library, which is a simulation software for chemical processes. The 3D visualization was created using the Unity game engine and the SceneView camera. The emulator was tested and validated by reviewing the documentation, code and the emulator itself.
