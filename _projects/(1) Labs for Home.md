# Labs for Home

Labs for Home is an interactive 3D lab simulation game designed to increase student engagement and learning outcomes in the classroom. The game is divided into parts:

1-Science Explorer Kit: A tool of infinite possibilities built with passion and care, with over 45 components and 30 experiments that the users are endless. The kit covers the subjects of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, making learning more accessible and fun for students. The main component of the kit is Arduino, making it an excellent choice for those who want to explore the world of electronics and robotics.

2-Virtual Labs: A game that will strive to be something unlike anything ever seen in the education software sector. With over 50 experiments and a theme based approach to learning, we help students get more in touch with the behavior of plants, temperature and others. The system will not only help students learn but also change the way a kidâ€™s skill is graded.

I worked on automating the game building and deployment process using GitHub Actions, utilizing Unity Addressable system to download the game content from the cloud, and creating a 3D interactive lab simulation game for schools that increases student engagement and learning outcomes.
