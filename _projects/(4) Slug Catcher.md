# Slug Catcher

**Slug Catcher** is a simulation of a unit in the gas refinery or petroleum industry from a previous generation where slugs (large quantities of a liquid) are collected at the outlet of pipelines. The unit's purpose is to catch and remove slugs from the pipeline to prevent them from reaching the processing units and causing damage. This generation has advanced technology that allows for an interactive 3D visualization of how the Slug Catcher works, providing a more immersive and educational experience for the user.

This application provides a detailed and interactive 3D visualization of how the Slug Catcher works, allowing the user to explore the inner workings of the unit and gain a deeper understanding of how it operates.
